# Chrono-Causal Tapestry (CCT) - The Genesis Project

This repository contains the foundational source code for the Chrono-Causal Tapestry (CCT), a next-generation AI architecture.

Our mission is to move beyond statistical pattern matching towards a system based on the first principles of causality, time, and meaning.
